# 🧑‍💻 Quantum Computing Notebooks

A collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks exploring **quantum computing concepts** using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/).  
This repository serves as both my learning journey and a portfolio of quantum experiments — from **superposition** to **entanglement** and beyond.

## 📘 Contents

### 1. Superposition
📂 `Superposition.ipynb`  
Demonstrates how a single qubit can exist in a **superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩** using the Hadamard gate.  
Includes Bloch sphere visualization and measurement results.

### 2. Bell States & Entanglement
📂 `BellStates_Entanglement.ipynb`  
Builds all four **Bell states (Φ⁺, Φ⁻, Ψ⁺, Ψ⁻)** using Qiskit.  
Explains how entanglement works, shows measurement correlations, and visualizes results with histograms.

### 3. Grover’s Algorithm *(coming soon 🚧)*
📂 `GroversAlgorithm.ipynb`  
Implementation of Grover’s search algorithm for unstructured databases.  
Shows how quantum computers can speed up search problems compared to classical ones.

### 4. Quantum Teleportation *(coming soon 🚧)*
📂 `QuantumTeleportation.ipynb`  
Demonstrates the **quantum teleportation protocol** — transferring a qubit’s state from one location to another using entanglement and classical communication.
